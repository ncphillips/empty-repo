introduction: We discuss the complexities of acquisitions and the effect such mergers
  can have on brand and identity, particularly within the communications landscape.

  content: <p>According to <a href="https://resultsig.com/">Results International</a>,
    in the past year, mergers and acquisitions in the marketing and communications
    industry have increased by 4%. And with further consolidation predicted, it looks
    like more shake ups are on the cards in 2019. This begs the question COLON when you
    have two well-established businesses with different, but well communicated propositions,
    how do you approach effectively bringing them both together under one brand?</p><p
    class="p1">The issue of brand and identity can easily be dismissed as a fluffy
    one, but it’s fundamental to get right when two organisations come together –
    especially for decision making and planning. Who are we now? What do we stand
    for? Who do we sell to? These issues can be fraught with difficulties, and clarity
    around brand and purpose is often the best touchstone to answer such questions.
    This is often why you see so many Surname/Surname brands in communications rather
    than conceptual ones – the brand is often set by the personalities of the leaders
    behind the business, rather than trying to shape something new.</p><p class="p1">Every
    new business brand demands a unique approach based on their identities and direction.
    We recently set to establish a new identity following the acquisition of Limelight,
    a PR firm with a 16-year heritage in B2B comms, by Acceleris; a firm boasting
    their own, well established history and identity. The businesses also benefited
    from complementary, broad and non-conflicting client bases from a range of different
    industries. Usually following a merger or acquisition there may be a naturally
    dominant or better positioned brand – in this case, each were strong in their
    own right, and a third way was needed.</p>

  content: "<p>Our creative director, John Taylor, said COLON Mergers can be a tinderbox
    for office politics. Brand can play a crucial role here in preventing a sense
    of ‘us and them’ when two organisations come together.</p>"

  blockquote: Instead of retaining ‘one way, one name, one ethos’ and a ‘my way
    or the highway’ approach, brand consultation offers a way to blend the strengths
    of both organisations and unite staff from both sides.
  content: <p>Engaging staff in this process can help immeasurably, often smoothing
    the transition by fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration, rather than
    fear of invasion and occupation.</p><p class="p1">The best place to start with
    any organisation is its people – they’re at the core of the service, values and
    culture while also being key to client relationships. It’s critical the new brand
    is authentic and both reflects and represents them. Staff also have the clearest
    sense of the kind of business they want to be working for, as well as being an
    essential part of communicating and driving forward the business in the future.
    In a series of workshops and sessions, Definition’s people not only contributed
    to name ideas based on some core brand personas, but also helped define and refine
    their brand values – namely to advise wisely; deliver consistently; support positively
    and think differently.</p>

  content: <p>It’s also important not to forget that when two established brands come
    together, there is already a lot of pride, emotion and equity wedded to existing
    identities – this is why an impartial third party can be essential in giving a
    trusted adviser perspective. But that level of trust also has to be established
    with the branding partner, as such an extensive process can be expensive to roll
    out, and damaging to businesses if they get it wrong.</p><p class="p1">For a communications
    agency, especially one that promised to be ‘Defining Reputations’, to misstep
    would be a tremendous error, which is why so many creative businesses play it
    safe.</p><p class="p1">It’s fair to say that the resulting brand, Definition,
    has been a resounding success so far and represents the wise, calm and brave character
    of the new business. The new identity, inspired by the new name and the new collective
    values, has delivered a powerful single banner beneath which all teams can unite
    and march as one.</p>

  content: "<p>Creative Director, John added COLON Definition represents a coming of age
    for both organisations. It was only right that their visual language reflected
    this by feeling mature, sophisticated and understated. One of the core concepts
    with the Definition brand was that they are there to define the reputations of
    others, it is their clients that are the stars. So creating an elegant, recessive
    and minimal look and feel allowed them to take centre stage while Definition controlled
    the spotlight.</p>"
- template: blog-post-halves
  blockquote: The entire brand revolved around this concept, being the light that
    defines others. The word mark itself has no edges, it is only defined by the light
    falling on it.
  content: "<p>It marks a logical departure from both existing brands, but one which
    embraces and reflects its aim to define reputations by protecting, promoting and
    projecting the profile of its clients. It’s a clean and fresh approach which clients
    have loved and sets the tone for the direction the business wants to head. And
    it has united three offices in three very different locations. Whether all of
    the rebrands still to come this year will prove as unifying, only time will tell.</p>"
